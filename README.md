# data-sourcing-challenge
Module 6 Challenge due 6/26/24. Created by Cassy Miller

## Info
This module uses APIs from NYT and TMBD in order to parse through NYT reviews and match them to the movie information from TMBD.

The raw python code can be found in the "retrieve_movie_data_final.ipynb" and the final output is in the "Final_Data_Output.csv"

API Keys are property of Cassy Miller.
